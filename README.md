# Market_Research_Project
Conducted analysis to identify opportunities for a movie rental shopâ€™s transition to an online service using Tableau, Excel, and SQL queries.

## Context
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores worldwide. Facing stiff competition from streaming services, its management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service to stay competitive. 

Using data loaded into a relational database management system (RDBMS) and SQL to perform various query-based analyses, I have compiled the results into an easily digestible format for the Management Board. 

## Key Questions
The Management Board has asked a series of business questions, and
they expect data-driven answers to be used for their company strategy. 

- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
